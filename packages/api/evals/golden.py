"""Golden dataset for the recap eval — 12 quick + 2 deep cases over a real library.

Each case is a snapshot of a real recap call. The player's prior sessions go
straight into ``inputs.previous_wrap_ups`` (no DB seed) as the same dicts the app
builds: each carries the raw note PLUS the ``extracted_state`` the wrap-up
extraction would derive (location / next_action / level / current_quest), so the
eval input matches production. ``reference`` holds the rubric the checks + judge
grade against.

The cases are spread on purpose across four axes — known/obscure to the model,
amount of history, note quality, and spoiler surface — so the set measures
*quality*, not plumbing, when run against a real model. Two ``deep_recap`` cases
exercise the LangGraph deep-research path (search → grade → refine → synthesize →
spoiler-aware → anti-hallucination), not just the quick single-shot recap.

``mentions`` are restricted to distinctive proper nouns (good recall targets);
common nouns are paraphrasable and would make recall brittle.
