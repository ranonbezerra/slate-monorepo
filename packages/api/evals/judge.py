"""LLM-as-judge for the eval harness.

The judge scores qualities the deterministic checks can't — faithfulness,
helpfulness, tone — on a ``[0, 1]`` scale. ``LLMJudge`` renders a rubric and
calls the existing ``AbstractLLMClient`` (the ``smart`` role); ``DummyJudge``
returns a fixed score so CI is deterministic and model-free.
