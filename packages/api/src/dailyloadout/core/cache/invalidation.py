"""Service-layer cache invalidation (ROADMAP Epic 18).

Maps domain events to the cache keys they invalidate. Keeping this here — rather
than scattering ``cache.delete*`` calls across services — means the event →
busted-keys map lives in one auditable place, and callers express intent
("a play_session changed for this user") instead of poking key strings.

Invalidation is **ambient**, like ``structlog``'s logger: callers just say
``await invalidate_user_stats(user_id)`` and this module resolves the process
cache itself (memoised singleton; ``NullCache`` under tests / when disabled). No
service needs to hold or thread a cache for the write side. The optional *cache*
argument exists only so the function can be unit-tested with a fake.
