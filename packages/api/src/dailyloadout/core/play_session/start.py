"""Shared play_session-start orchestration (ROADMAP Epic 12 — Unified PlaySession Pipeline).

The single place a PlaySession is created, regardless of how the game was chosen —
a direct start, an accepted Loadout, or (later) the Concierge. Centralising it
keeps the "one active play_session per user" constraint mapping and the
``last_played_at`` stamp consistent across every entrance to the play loop.
