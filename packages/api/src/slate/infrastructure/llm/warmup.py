"""Preload Ollama models on startup so the first request isn't a cold load.

A cold model load (especially the 7B let_me_carry agent) can take tens of seconds
and, with no streamed output during the agent's first tool-deciding call, looks
like a hang. Warming the configured models in the background at startup means
the model is resident by the time the user sends a message.

Best-effort: any failure (Ollama down, model missing) is logged and skipped —
warming never blocks or breaks startup.
