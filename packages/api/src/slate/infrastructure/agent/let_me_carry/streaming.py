"""Streaming protocol for the let_me_carry (ROADMAP Epic 16).

Two concerns live here:

* the typed events an agent emits while a turn streams (`TokenEvent`,
  `ToolEvent`), and
* the `RecommendationGate` — the filter that lets prose tokens through live but
  **withholds the trailing ``RECOMMEND: <id>`` marker** until the turn ends, so
  the UUID guard can validate the pick before it ever reaches the user.

The marker is a line of the form ``RECOMMEND: <library_entry id>``. Both the
agent prompt and the service guard depend on this shape, so the regex and the
split helper live here, shared.
